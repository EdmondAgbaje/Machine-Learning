**Machine Learning projects**

Dataset contains data for classifying a star as a pulsar or not. Features are based on
a number of values extracted from astronomical imaging. **(pulsar_star_19366741.csv)**

Prediction models developed to classify stars from this dataset. Models include SVMs,KNN and Decision Tress and there performances are evaluated.
